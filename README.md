## 🔒 Security
As a demo application, this project uses mock credentials. For production implementations, follow the instructions in the [Polaris Merchant App](../polaris-merchant-app).

## 🚀 Polaris BNPL System
User -> Shopify Store -> Polaris Checkout -> `polaris-core` settles on Creditcoin/Sepolia via `polaris-protocol`.

## 🔒 Privacy-Preserving BNPL (Fhenix FHEVM)
The demo shopping application utilizes Fhenix Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHEVM) to ensure that:
* The customer's exact debt position remains confidential.
* Collateral verification is performed homomorphically, ensuring liquidations are shielded from front-running and predatory targeting.
* Credit score updates are calculated privately on-chain under `ScoreManager`.
